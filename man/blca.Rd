\description{
A dataset containing the normalized (by variance stabilizing transformation,
\code{DESeq2::vst()}) RNAseq expression of 10 randomly sampled tumors from
the bladder cancer cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas.
}
\details{
To reduce size of dataset, the genes that expressed in the lowest 20% (taking
ALL tumors into account, before random sampling) were removed from the
dataset.
