Description: The ESTIMATE package infers tumor purity from expression data as a 
  function of immune and stromal infiltrate, but requires writing of intermediate 
  files, is un-pipeable, and performs poorly when presented with modern datasets 
  with current gene symbols. tidyestimate a fast, tidy, modern reimagination of
  ESTIMATE.
